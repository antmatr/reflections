When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It is suitable when more then one person is working with the repository,
and/or you want to have access to the repository from different computers.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

May be it is not comfortable to resolve merge conflicts that may take place after pull if you have some commits in your local repository not pushed yet.
