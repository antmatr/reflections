What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

On initialization Git creates hidden directory to store information about repository, commits etc.
Git create a kind of its own infrastructure environment for further work.
It is needed because without it there will be no any specific information,
that allows Git to recognize repository.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is like buffer between working area and repository.
It allows you to combine some of changes you've made into logical units to be committed separately.
